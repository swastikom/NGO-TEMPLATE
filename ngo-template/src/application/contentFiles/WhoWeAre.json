    "journey":"In the year 1999, inspired by a shared vision, Sajal Kanti Kayal and four enthusiastic youths initiated a transformative journey in the village of Kankura in Diamond Harbour. They launched a theatre group exclusively for women, aiming to elevate them from the confines of the kitchen to the forefront of society. The mission was clearâ€”to instill leadership, self-confidence, self-respect, and the ability to amplify their voices within the community. As the theatre group made impactful strides, the team, led by Mr. Sajal and his friends, recognized the pressing need for quality education in the village. In 2000, they took a pioneering step by establishing Tiyas School. The name 'Tiyas,' meaning thirsty, encapsulated the essence of their mission: to provide the nourishing waters of education and knowledge to eager young minds. The school's vision extended beyond conventional learning, aiming to uplift society by nurturing responsible and well-educated citizens. Understanding the challenges faced by high school students without guidance at home, the team swiftly established a remedial center the following year. This center aimed to support students in comprehending their classroom learning, fostering a holistic approach to education. With their welfare activities gaining momentum, the team recognized the need for a more structured and organized approach. In 2003, on October 28th, their commitment culminated in the official registration of Kankura Masat Social Welfare Society under the  Society act of Government of West Bengal. This pivotal moment marked the formalization of their dedication to reaching more people with impactful services and welfare activities, solidifying their mission to bring positive change to the community.",
